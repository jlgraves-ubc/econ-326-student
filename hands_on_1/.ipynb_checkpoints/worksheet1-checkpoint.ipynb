    "In this tutorial, we will be working with some real-world data: the 2020 Canadian Labour Force Survey, provided by Statistics Canada[<sup id=\"fn1s\">1</sup>](#fn1).  We will learn more about this dataset later, but let's first get a handle on it by using the data in our **Notebook** (this file).  In order to do this, we first need to import the data.  Essentially, we need to tell our computer how to interpret the data so that we can use it for econometric analysis.  In general, importing data can be more difficult than you might expect - there can be issues with formatting, memory, and other kinds of problems.  Fortunately, for this course we have the luxury of working with relatively \"nice\" data.\n",

This is _real data_ on real Canadians, and is representative of the overall Canadian population.  Wow!\n",

    "* Each column represents a single variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine this as a spreadsheet in a program like Excel.  This is the way most statistical programs like to recieve data - but it _isn't_ a property of the data itself.  It is only a representation; there can be other kinds of representations.  For example, a panel dataset might have each row as a unit (e.g. country) and each column might represent a variable in a year (e.g. unemployment in 2016, unemployment in 2017, etc.).  Often, when we work with real-world data we have to reshape it in order for it to be usable - but in this course, we won't worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data comes in many different formats, which must be interpreted by our statistical programs.  Essentially, we need to tell them what the data means.  This is referred to as **importing** data.  There are different techniques for importing data in different formats; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importing data from a ```.dta``` file: this is data that was created by the statistical software STATA and is commonly used in economics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of these formats has a special **method** associated with it.  Methods are commands, stored in R packages, that tell R to do things.  In fact, you're already seen one!  The ```library(...)``` method imports whatever package is in the brackets into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing our ```.dta``` file into memory, using the ```read_dta``` method.  When we read things into memory, we normally want to use them later, so we have to give them a name.  Let's call this ```census_data``` so we can refer to it later on:"

    "## The Immigrant Wage Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada is a nation where immigration is very important, both to our society and to our economy: As the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-looks-to-immigration-to-boost-economic-recovery-11617105739) writes, \"Canada is among the most immigrant-reliant advanced economies in the world. Before the pandemic, net migration accounted for more than 80% of Canada’s population growth, compared with about 40% in the U.S.\"   Canada prides itself on being a welcoming, multi-cultural country: More than 20% of Canada's population are immigrants, and almost 40% of Canadian children have immigrant parents.   Immigrants come to Canada through three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Economic immigrants: individuals immigrating to Canada for economic reasons like a new job or business opportunity\n",
    "* Family immigrants: individuals immigrating to Canada to join a family member\n",
    "* Refugees: individuals immigrating to Canada to escape unrest or persecution in their home country\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada particularly tries to recruit and attract skilled immigrants; most immigrants who do not come as part of a family, or as refugees, are accepted under a [\"points system\"](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html), which particularly looks for immigrants who are (a) young, (b) well-educated, and (c) experienced in desirable fields (such as medicine or engineering).  While refugees receive a lot of press attention, about 60% of immigrants arrive through the economic category - they are seeking better opportunities for themselves and their families.  Each of the other categories is about 20% of the immigrant population.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest debates around immigration concerns their abilities to contribute economically to Canadian society.  Economic immigrants are explicitly selected on this basis but they face many challenges integrating into Canadian society.  This can result in serious problems finding a job: we see that immigrants frequently earn a lower wage than domestically born Canadians.  We call this the immigrant wage gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of \"why this gap exists\" is critically important, because it tells us whether this is a problem in terms of maximizing the economic benefits of our immigrant population.  It also informs the kinds of policies we should carry out.  To see why this might be a debate, consider the following three rationales for why this gap exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immigrants are paid less than domestic-born Canadians because they have less education and less skills than domestic Canadians.\n",
    "  * If this is the case, immigrants are competing with other low-skill or low-education native Canadians for jobs.  Is this desirable?\n",
    "2. Immigrants are paid less than domestic-born Canadians because Canadian businesses do not recognize their education or professional credentials.  You have probably heard the story of a doctor driving a cab for a living, or a nurse working as a hospital cleaner.\n",
    "  * If this is the case, immigrants are being underemployed and not using their skills to the maximum extent.  This is undesirable.\n",
    "3. Immigrants are paid less than domestic-born Canadians because immigrants are more likely to be women, younger, and have children, all of which are groups which earn lower wages.\n",
    "  * If this is the case, then the wage gap is largely a product of demographics interacting with existing wage gaps (like the gender wage gap) in the Canadian economy.  This implies that the immigrant-wage gap is not a problem _in and of itself_: it's a consequence of other economic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these rationales is correct?  We don't know.  In fact, all of them might be true to some extent, or maybe none of them.  Maybe there's an alternative - you probably have an opinion on this topic, particularly if you're an immigrant or have an immigrant background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to doing research is to understand how we can use data to try and investigate each of these rationales.  Much of what we are going to do is to help us determine if these explanations are plausible, and to what degree.    We need to think about how the different explanations would manifest in our data.  Essentially, each explanation is going to create a \"pattern\" - we need to figure out how we can use detect and analyze this pattern.  This is the processing of econometric modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the first rationale is true, if we compare immigrants and domestic-born Canadians with the same education and experience, the gap should go away.\n",
    "2.  If the second rationale is true, if we compare immigrants and domestic-born Canadians with similar credentials, the gap should still exist.\n",
    "3.  If the third rationale is true, if we we compare immigrants and domestic-born Canadians with similar demographic characteristics, the gap should go away.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also start to dig deeper into these explanations, to try to understand the fundamental causes, and answer our research question:\n",

    "> **Advanced Note**: _piping_ The above example uses a special R command called a **pipe** (``%>%``).  Mechanically, what piping does is insert the object before the pipe into the object after the pipe.  For example, if we have ``z <- f(x,y)`` we could write this using pipes as ``z <- x %>% f(y)``.  Piping is really most useful when you are chaining (piping) a series of commands together.  You can then of a pipe as saying _and then_ followed by a command.  The item before the pipe will be inputted into the next command.  This lets you do complex data manipulation in a way with is readable.\n",

You can always find a way to do something without using a pipe, but you should still learn how to read them and use them.\n",

    "## Immigrant wage gap and education\n",
    "\n",
    "One important dimension of the immigrant-wage gap is the role of education.  Many professions, such as engineering, medicine, and law face licensing and professional requirements.  Even the most talented lawyer from India cannot provide law in Canada without obtaining the proper credentials.  These can create major barriers to employing immigrants, even skilled ones, to their full extent in the Canadian economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, historically many licensing requirements were explicitly designed to keep immigrants out of certain industries, to preserve higher wages for native Canadians.  An infamous example in Canada occured in the 1920s, when many provinces (including BC) passed laws requiring barbers and hairdressers to get a license to cut hair.  Why?  Ostensibly it was for \"health\" reasons - but the real reason was to force Asian barbers (primarily Chinese) out of business, and keep prices high.  The barber licenses were nearly impossible for Asian barbers to get, forcing them out of business or onto the black market.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this kind of outright racism and discrimination is no longer commonplace, many economists view licenses and professional credentials in a similar light.  At the very least, they hinder integration into the economy - are the benefits of licenses higher than the costs?\n",

    "As we mentioned in earlier in the lesson, one reason why immigrants may be paid less than non-immigrants on average is that the former have a higher concentration of women than the latter. The gap could also be driven by differences in average wages between immigrant women and non-immigrant women. To examine this argument, test for an immigrant wage gap _in men only_ (store this in ``tmen`` for testing). Visualize this difference by plotting the wage distributions of immigrant and non-immigrant men with a histogram (store with ``hist_men``). Then, test for an immigrant wage gap within college-educated men (``tmenhs``) and high-school-educated men (``tmenbach``)."
