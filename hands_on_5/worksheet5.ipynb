    "# Part 1: Interactions in Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common extensions to multiple regression models is to include **interaction** terms.  What is an interaction term?  It's basically a term which represents the product of two (or more) variables in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dummy variable for being an immigrant ($I_i$) and a dummy variable for having a college degree ($D_i$), the _interaction_ of these two variables is the product $D_i \\times I_i$.  This can seem complicated but it also has a simple interpretation: it is now a dummy for being _both_ an immigrant and having a college degree.  You can see why this is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_i \\times I_i = 1 \\iff D_i = 1 \\text{ and } I_i = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why these terms are so important for understanding regressions: they provide us with a simple way to describe and study how _combinations_ of our explanatory variables impact our model.  These variables enter into our regression models in exactly the same way as usual:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I_i + \\beta_2 D_i + \\beta_3 D_i \\times I_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can see that this is just a multiple regression model - the only difference is that one of the variables is a combination of the other variables.  From an estimation perspective, there's no issue - you can use OLS to estimate a model with interaction terms, just like normal.  However, as we have seen, there are important differences when it comes to the _interpretation_ of these models.  Let's learn more about this in this worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (in general) two ways to create interactions in R: (i) manually (i.e. creating a new variables which is $D_i \\times I_i$ then adding it to the regression), or (ii) using the built-in tools in R.  However, method (i) is a trap!  You should never use this method.  Why?  There are two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The main reason is that R (and you, the analyst) lose track of the relationship between the created interaction variable and the underlying variables.  This means that you can't use other tools to analyse these relationship (there are many packages such as ``margins`` which allow you to investigate complex interaction) which is a big loss.  You also can't perform post-regression analysis on the underlying variables in a simple way anymore.\n",
    "2.  The second reason is that it's easy to make mistakes.  You might define the interaction incorrectly (possible!).  However, it's more of an issue if later on you change the underlying variables and then forget to re-compute the interactions.  It also makes your code harder to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: don't do it.  Interaction in R are easy to create: you simply use the ``:`` or ``*`` operator when defining an interaction term.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``:`` operator creates the interaction(s) of the two variables in question\n",
    "* The ``*`` operation creates the interactions(s) _and_ the main effects of the variables as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better: if you are interacting two qualitative (factor) variables, it will automatically \"expand\" the interaction into every possible combination of the variables.  A lot less work!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at a regression model which interacts immigration status and sex:"

    "There are a few important things to notice about this regression result.  First, take a close look at the terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``immstatimmigrants`` this is the main effect for being an immigrant.  You _might_ immediately say that this is the impact of being an immigrant - but this is _not true_.  Why?  Because immigrant shows up in two places!  We have to be a little more careful - this is the effect of being an immigrant for individuals in the base group (female respondents) \n",
    "* ``immstatimmigrants:sexmale`` this is the interaction effect of being a man an being an immigrant.  Basically, male immigrants earn -3200 less than female immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this interpretation in the regression model itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I_i + \\beta_2 S_i + \\beta_3 I_i \\times S_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta W_i}{\\Delta I_i} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 S_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginal effect of being an immigrant _changes_ depending on what the value of $S_i$ is!  For women (the level where $S_i = 0$) it's $\\beta_1$.  For men (the level where $S_i =1$), it's $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3$.  This is why, in an interaction model, it doesn't really make sense to talk about the \"effect of immigration\" - because there isn't a single, immutable effect.  It is different for different people!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can talk about the _average_ effect, which is just $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\bar{S_i}$ - but that's not really what people are asking about when they are discussing the immigration effect, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's very important to carefully think about a regression model with interaction terms - the model may seem simple to estimate, but the interpretation is more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactions with Continuous Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have just looked at interacting qualitative variables - but you can interact any types of variables!\n",

    "* Qualitative-Quantitative\n",
    "* Quantitative-Quantitative\n",
    "\n",
    "The format and syntax in R is similar, with some small exceptions to deal with certain combinations of variables.  However (again), you do need to be careful with interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at the interaction of wages and sex on market income.  In a regression equation, this would be expressed like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_i = \\beta_0  + \\beta_1 W_i + \\beta_2 S_i + \\beta_3 W_i \\times S_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial M_i}{\\partial W_i} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 S_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two _different_ \"slope\" coefficients; basically, male and female respondents can have a different return to wages.  Let's see this in R:"

    "This addresses the common problem of estimating a regression model where you think the impact of a continuous variable might be different across the two groups.  One approach would be to run the model only for men, and only for women, the compare - but this isn't a good idea.  Those regressions have a much smaller sample size, and if you have other controls in the model, you will \"throw away\" information.  The interaction method is much better.\n",

    "You might have been puzzled by why these models were called \"linear\" regressions.  The reason is because they are linear in the _coefficients_: the dependent variable is expressed as  a linear combination of the explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that we can use the same methods (OLS) to estimate models that including linear combinations of _non-linear functions_ of the explanatory variables.  We have actually already seen an example of this: remember using ``log`` of a variable?  That's a non-linear function!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned when considering ``log``, the most important difference here is again regarding interpretations, not the actual estimation.\n",

This is because we have estimated a quadratic relationship; the slope of a quadratic changes as the explanatory variable changes.  That's what we're seeing here!\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes these models relatively difficult to interpret, since the marginal effects change (often dramatically) as the explanatory variables change.  You frequently need to carefully interpret the model and often (to get estimates) perform tests on _combinations_ of coefficients, which can be done using things like the ``car`` package or the ``lincom`` function.  You can also compute this manually, using the formula for the sum of variances.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason is actually approximation.  Consider the following _non-linear_ model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = f(X_i) + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is truly non-linear (and not just in terms of the parameters).  How can we estimate this model?  It's hard!  There are techniques to estimate complex models like this, but how far can we get with good-old OLS?  The answer is - provided that $f$ is \"smooth\" - pretty far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to introductory calculus; you might remember a theorem called _Taylor's Theorem_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem).  It says that a smoothly differentiable function can be arbitrarily well-approximated (about a point) by a polynomial expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \\cdots + \\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k + R_k(x)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Look closely at this expression.  Most of the terms (like $f'(a)$) are constants.  In fact, you can show that this can be written like:\n",

    "$$f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x^k + r$$\n",

What this say is actually very important: linear regression models can be viewed as _approximations_ to nonlinear regressions, provided we have enough polynomial terms.  This is one complication: the error term is definitely not uncorrelated.  You can learn more about how to address this issue in other courses, but at the most the omitted variable bias is relatively small as $k \\to \\infty$."
